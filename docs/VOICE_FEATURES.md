# Voice Features for Nagatha Assistant

This document describes Nagatha's voice capabilities, including Discord voice channel integration, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech functionality.

## Overview

Nagatha now supports voice interactions through Discord voice channels! She can:

- **Join and leave voice channels** using slash commands
- **Listen to speech** and convert it to text using OpenAI Whisper
- **Speak responses** using OpenAI's text-to-speech with a warm, professional voice
- **Maintain conversation context** in voice channels just like text chat
- **Handle mixed interactions** - voice conversations with text responses for URLs, images, etc.

## Voice Characteristics

Nagatha's voice is designed to match her personality - warm, professional, and engaging:

- **Voice Model**: OpenAI TTS with "alloy" voice (closest to Julia Child-like warmth)
- **Personality**: Professional yet approachable, like a brilliant librarian
- **Communication Style**: Clear, engaging, and encouraging
- **Context Awareness**: Remembers conversation history and builds relationships

## Setup Requirements

## Voice Conversation Flow

### 1. Starting a Voice Session

1. **Join a voice channel** using `/join`
2. **Speak naturally** - Nagatha will listen and respond
3. **Use text commands** when needed for complex interactions

### 2. Voice Interaction

- **Speech-to-Text**: Your voice is converted to text using Whisper
- **AI Processing**: Nagatha processes your message like any text conversation
- **Text-to-Speech**: Nagatha's response is converted to speech using OpenAI TTS
- **Context Preservation**: Conversation history is maintained throughout the session

### 3. Mixed Interactions

When Nagatha needs to share URLs, images, or complex information:

1. **Voice Response**: "I found that information for you. Let me share the details in text chat."
2. **Text Response**: Sends the full information with links/images to the text channel
3. **Voice Continuation**: Continues the voice conversation naturally

### 4. Ending a Session

- **Manual**: Use `/leave` to end the session
- **Automatic**: Nagatha may leave if the channel becomes empty
- **Session Cleanup**: Conversation history is preserved for future interactions

## Voice Features

### Speech Recognition
- **Model**: OpenAI Whisper (base model)
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy for clear speech

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Clear Speech**: Speak clearly for better recognition
2. **Natural Pace**: Speak at a normal conversational pace
3. **Mixed Communication**: Use text for complex queries, voice for conversation
4. **Patience**: Allow time for speech processing and response generation

### For Server Administrators

1. **Permissions**: Ensure bot has necessary voice permissions
2. **Channel Setup**: Create dedicated voice channels for AI interaction
3. **User Guidelines**: Provide clear instructions for voice interaction
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor voice channel usage and bot performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Voice functionality not available"
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies or configuration
- **Solution**: Install PyNaCl, ffmpeg-python, and openai-whisper

#### "Failed to join voice channel"
- **Cause**: Missing permissions or channel issues
- **Solution**: Check bot permissions and channel settings

#### "Speech-to-Text: ‚ùå"
- **Cause**: Whisper model not loaded
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and model download

#### "Text-to-Speech: ‚ùå"
- **Cause**: OpenAI API key not configured
- **Solution**: Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

#### Poor speech recognition
- **Cause**: Background noise or unclear speech
- **Solution**: Speak clearly in a quiet environment

#### Audio quality issues
- **Cause**: Discord audio settings or network issues
- **Solution**: Check Discord voice settings and internet connection

### Syncing Commands

If voice commands don't appear, sync the slash commands:

**From Discord (Admin only):**
```
/sync
```

**From CLI (provides guidance):**
```bash
nagatha discord sync
```

**Note:** Commands are automatically synced when the bot starts. If you've added new voice commands, restart the bot:
```bash
nagatha discord stop && nagatha discord start
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot voice issues:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
nagatha discord start
```

### Voice Status Check

Use `/voice-status` to check:
- Connection status
- Capability availability
- Session information
- Error diagnostics

## Advanced Configuration

### Voice Settings

You can customize voice behavior through environment variables:

```bash
# OpenAI TTS voice selection
export NAGATHA_TTS_VOICE="alloy"  # Options: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer

# Whisper model size
export NAGATHA_WHISPER_MODEL="base"  # Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large

# Audio quality settings
export NAGATHA_AUDIO_VOLUME="0.8"  # Volume level (0.0-1.0)
export NAGATHA_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE="48000"  # Sample rate for audio processing
```

### Performance Optimization

For better performance:

1. **Use smaller Whisper models** for faster processing
2. **Optimize network settings** for Discord voice
3. **Monitor system resources** during voice sessions
4. **Use dedicated voice channels** to reduce interference

## Security Considerations

### Privacy
- **Voice Data**: Audio is processed locally when possible
- **Transcription**: Speech-to-text results may be logged for debugging
- **Storage**: No voice recordings are permanently stored
- **Sharing**: Voice conversations follow the same privacy rules as text

### Permissions
- **Bot Permissions**: Only grant necessary voice permissions
- **User Access**: Control who can use voice features
- **Channel Access**: Limit voice features to appropriate channels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Voice Connection Issues

#### Error 4006: Connection Closed
- **Cause**: Bot lacks proper voice permissions
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check bot permissions in Discord server settings
  2. Ensure bot has "Connect", "Speak", and "Use Voice Activity" permissions
  3. Verify Server Members Intent is enabled in Discord Developer Portal
  4. Re-invite the bot with proper permissions

#### Error 1006: Network Issues
- **Cause**: Unstable internet connection or Discord server issues
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and Discord status

#### Error 4001: Authentication Issues
- **Cause**: Invalid bot token or expired credentials
- **Solution**: Regenerate bot token in Discord Developer Portal

### Permission Checklist

- ‚úÖ **Connect** - Join voice channels
- ‚úÖ **Speak** - Transmit audio in voice channels
- ‚úÖ **Use Voice Activity** - Use voice activity detection
- ‚úÖ **View Channels** - See voice channels
- ‚úÖ **Send Messages** - Respond to voice commands

### Discord Developer Portal Settings

In your Discord application settings:
1. **Bot Section**: Enable "Server Members Intent"
2. **OAuth2 Scopes**: Include `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. **Bot Permissions**: Include all voice-related permissions

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Bot Status**:
   ```bash
   nagatha discord status
   ```

2. **Test Voice Permissions**:
   - Try `/voice-status` command
   - Check if bot can see voice channels

3. **Verify Intents**:
